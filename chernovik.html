      OSRS Fire Giants: Strategy, Tips & Drops - RSPS List
    </h2>
    <p class="pt-3">
      Fire Giants are key targets in Old School RuneScape (OSRS) for players
      looking to improve their combat skills and earn valuable rewards. This
      guide will cover the fire giant drop table, strategies for killing a fire
      giant, and tips for maximizing your Slayer experience.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="color-blue fs-32 fw-medium">What are the OSRS Fire Giants?</h3>
    <p class="pt-3">
      Fire Giants are one of the strongest categories of giants in OSRS. They
      have 86, 104, and 109 combat levels, making them more challenging than
      Ice, Moss, and Hill Giants. Players often choose Fire Giants OSRS for
      training Ranged and Slayer skills because of their high fire giant drop
      rate and useful drops, like the <b>Rune Scimitar</b>.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-3">
      These giants are commonly assigned by various Slayer Masters, making them
      accessible for players of different levels. Their locations across
      Gielinor allow players to engage them quickly, either through direct
      combat or by using safe spots.
      <b>The Fire Giant boss guide</b> helps players understand how to tackle
      these monsters effectively.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-3">
      When considering what level to fight fire giants, it's advisable to have
      at least
      <b>70 in Attack, Strength, and Defense</b>. Fire Giants are aggressive and
      can provide a good Slayer experience, though they do not drop superior
      creatures, which may affect the profitability of the fire giant task.
    </p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="color-blue fs-32 fw-medium">Requirements</h3>
    <p class="pt-3">
      Before killing fire giants in OSRS, you must be prepared for stats and
      equipment. While it's possible to fight them at lower levels, it's
      recommended to have at least the following stats for an easier time:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-styled d-flex flex-column gap-3 pt-3">
      <li>Combat Level: 85+</li>
      <li>Attack/Strength/Defense: 70+</li>
      <li>Ranged: 70+</li>
      <li>Slayer Level: 40 (if fighting them as a Slayer task)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Although these levels are not mandatory, they make the fight more
      manageable and efficient.
      <b>Lower-level players</b> should take extra caution with healing supplies
      and Prayer Protection, while <b>higher-level players</b> can focus on
      maximizing experience rates and drop chances.
